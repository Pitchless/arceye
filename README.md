The Eyes!

arceye-demo-3 - the demo you guys built on the river bank.

arceye-demo-4 - looks a bit like demo 3, you can edit the sameway, difference
                is that it will randomly wink and blink so you can just script
                eye motions.

Puppet. r - turns the random wink/blink on and off.
